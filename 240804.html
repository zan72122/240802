**Castleman Diseaseの分類**

Castleman disease (CD)は、特徴的な病理組織学的所見を共有する、少なくとも4つの疾患群です[r:1|s:1]。CDには、限局性CD (UCD)と多中心性CD (MCD)があり、後者はさらに特発性MCD (iMCD)、ヒトヘルペスウイルス8 (HHV8)関連MCD (HHV8-MCD)、多発性神経障害、臓器腫大、内分泌障害、単クローン性形質細胞疾患、皮膚変化 (POEMS)関連MCD (POEMS-MCD)に分類されます[r:1|s:1]。

**限局性CD (UCD)**

UCDは最も一般的なタイプで、患者の約75％を占めます[r:12|s:1]。UCDは、リンパ組織の良性限局性過形成であり、病理組織学的には、硝子血管型と形質細胞型に分けられます[r:12|s:1]。硝子血管型は、UCDの約75％を占め、退縮性胚中心、顕著な濾胞樹状細胞、硝子化血管を特徴とします[r:12|s:1][r:15|s:2]。形質細胞型は、間質に形質細胞のシート状浸潤を特徴とします[r:12|s:1]。UCDは通常、外科的切除により治癒します[r:12|s:1][r:15|s:4]。

**多中心性CD (MCD)**

MCDは、全身性のリンパ節腫脹、炎症性症状、臓器機能障害を特徴とする、潜在的に生命を脅かす可能性のある全身性疾患です[r:4|s:2]。MCDは、HHV8関連MCD、特発性MCD、POEMS症候群関連MCDの3つのタイプに分類されます[r:1|s:1][r:12|s:2]。

* **HHV8関連MCD (HHV8-MCD)**: 免疫抑制状態の患者、特にHIV感染者に多く見られます[r:1|s:1][r:9|s:4]。HHV8-MCDは、形質細胞型の組織像を示し、間質にHHV8陽性形質細胞のシート状浸潤を特徴とします[r:12|s:2]。

* **特発性MCD (iMCD)**: HHV8陰性で、原因不明のMCDです[r:1|s:1][r:9|s:7]。iMCDは、血小板減少、腹水、細網線維症、腎機能障害、臓器腫大 (iMCD-TAFRO)またはiMCD-その他 (iMCD-NOS)に細分類されます[r:1|s:1]。iMCD-TAFROは、血小板減少、重度の腹水、比較的低い血清免疫グロブリン値を特徴とし、iMCD-NOSは、血小板増加、軽度の腹水、高ガンマグロブリン血症を特徴とします[r:17|s:3]。

* **POEMS症候群関連MCD (POEMS-MCD)**: POEMS症候群は、末梢神経障害、臓器腫大、内分泌障害、M蛋白、皮膚変化を特徴とする、基礎となる形質細胞腫瘍による腫瘍随伴症候群です[r:3|s:3]。POEMS-MCDは、形質細胞型の組織像を示し、しばしば単クローン性形質細胞の浸潤が見られます[r:18|s:5]。

**鑑別診断**

CDの病理組織学的所見は、他の疾患、特にリンパ腫、形質細胞腫瘍、IgG4関連疾患と類似しているため、鑑別診断が重要です[r:6|s:8][r:24|s:1]。正確な診断には、臨床症状、検査所見、病理組織学的所見を総合的に評価する必要があります[r:32|s:3]。

**異常な胚中心**

HVCDの胚中心は、典型的には萎縮性または過形成性であり、しばしば複数の胚中心が単一の反応性リンパ濾胞内に存在し、「双晶」として知られています[r:33|s:4]。胚中心は、周囲のマントルゾーンのリンパ球によって同心円状に囲まれ、「タマネギの皮」のような配列を形成しています[r:1|s:13][r:30|s:4][r:97|s:3]。

**顕著な濾胞樹状細胞 (FDC)**

HVCDでは、FDCが顕著に増加し、胚中心やマントルゾーンに多く分布しています[r:18|s:4][r:30|s:4]。FDCは、しばしば異型性を示し、FDC肉腫との関連が指摘されています[r:33|s:4][r:420|s:1]。

**血管新生**

HVCDは、血管新生が活発であり、胚中心、マントルゾーン、濾胞間領域に多数の血管が見られます[r:1|s:13][r:18|s:4]。血管は、しばしば硝子化しており、胚中心に侵入して「ロリポップ」のような外観を呈することがあります[r:30|s:4][r:97|s:3]。

### SubGoal 2: 硝子血管型CDの病理組織学的所見を完了しました

TAFRO症候群では、肝臓、脾臓、心臓、肺などの臓器にも病変が見られることがあります[r:17]。肝臓では、肝細胞の萎縮、門脈周囲の線維化、胆汁鬱滞などが認められることがあります[r:153]。脾臓では、脾腫、細網線維症、巨核球の増加などが認められることがあります[r:153]。心臓では、心筋症、心膜炎などが認められることがあります[r:70]。肺では、間質性肺炎、リンパ球性間質性肺炎、肺胞出血などが認められることがあります[r:172][r:113]。

**鑑別診断**

TAFRO症候群の病理組織学的所見は、他の疾患、特にiMCD、POEMS症候群、感染症、自己免疫疾患と類似していることがあるため、鑑別診断が重要です[r:2][r:17][r:101]。正確な診断には、臨床症状、検査所見、病理組織学的所見を総合的に評価する必要があります[r:101]。

**臨床症状との関連**

TAFRO症候群は、血小板減少、全身性浮腫、発熱、腎機能障害、臓器腫大などの症状を呈します[r:101|s:1]。血小板減少は、出血傾向の原因となることがあり、重篤な場合には、致死的となることもあります[r:70|s:3]。全身性浮腫は、心不全、呼吸不全の原因となることがあります[r:70|s:3]。発熱は、高サイトカイン血症による全身性炎症反応を反映しています[r:101]。腎機能障害は、血栓性微小血管症様病変や膜性増殖性糸球体腎炎様病変によることがあります[r:153]。臓器腫大は、肝脾腫、リンパ節腫脹、心筋症などによることがあります[r:70][r:153]。

**予後**

TAFRO症候群は、予後不良な疾患であり、適切な治療を行わなければ、多臓器不全により死亡することがあります[r:17]。

Unicentric CD (UCD) is a benign, local hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue that is usually curable. Multicentric CD (MCD) manifests as a potentially life-threatening systemic disease with complex symptomatology which is mostly due to an overproduction of interleukin-6 (IL-6) or dysregulation of IL-6-related signaling pathways. From a therapeutic perspective, it is important to distinguish idiopathic MCD (iMCD) from those cases that are associated with the human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8 + MCD). SUMMARY: During recent years, it has become increasingly clear that even HHV-8-negative MCD is not a homogeneous entity and that there are clinically distinct variants.

The association between HVCD and FDC sarcoma is well-documented; dysplastic FDCs may be precursors to FDC sarcoma. Herein, we describe a case of HVCD with strikingly large and dysplastic FDCs, which raised the differential of Hodgkin lymphoma and other neoplasms. Scattered dysplastic FDCs were predominantly in germinal centers and mantle zones, and rarely in interfollicular areas. Although occasional germinal centers contained increased FDCs, no mass forming proliferations were present to suggest FDC sarcoma. Immunostaining demonstrated that the atypical FDCs expressed CD21, clusterin and CXCL13, but not CD23, S100, pankeratin or CD30; they aberrantly expressed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The present case demonstrates that dysplastic FDCs may be present as isolated cells that require immunophenotyping to distinguish them from malignant entities with similar morphologic features. A variety of FDC markers is required to confirm their origin as the expression of any single marker is not assured, as occurred in this case. Pathologists need be aware of FDC proliferations in HVCD because of their association with FDC sarcoma.

To date, Castleman disease remains incompletely understood due to its rareness and difficulties in clinical and pathological diagnosis. TAFRO syndrome was reported in Japan in 2010. Because lymph node histology is similar in patients with TAFRO syndrome and Castleman disease, TAFRO syndrome is described as a related disorder of Castleman disease. Clinically, however, these conditions differ markedly. Although elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression is characteristic of Castleman disease, increased expression of IL-6 may occur in patients with other diseases, making elevated IL-6 unsuitable for differential diagnosis.

We present two patients with TAFRO syndrome in whom renal biopsies were performed. CASE PRESENTATION: Both patients had subacute onset and exhibited renal insufficiency, edema, anemia, thrombocytopenia, polyserositis and lymphadenopathy over the disease course. However, there were many differences in their clinical manifestations. Case 1 was a 30-year-old woman admitted due to intermittent vaginal bleeding for 3\u2009weeks. Laboratory tests on admission showed severe renal insufficiency (creatinine: 624\u2009μmol/L), severe anemia (Hb: 41\u2009g/L), and moderate thrombocytopenia (61\u2009×\u2009109/L). Case 2 was a 42-year-old man. Acute epigastric pain was his initial complaint, and computed tomography (CT) revealed retroperitoneal exudation around the pancreas. He was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, and after treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and somatostatin, his abdominal pain still recurred. During treatment, renal failure gradually increased, with oliguria, fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia, edema and massive ascites.

Here, we report a case of acute progressive diffuse interstitial lung disease, diagnosed as non-specific interstitial pneumonia, preceding idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease. A 65-year-old male visited our outpatient clinic for dyspnea on exertion. Imaging tests revealed interstitial lung disease showing non-specific interstitial pneumonia pattern, pulmonary function test proved the decline of vital capacity and laboratory tests showed increased fibrosis biomarkers; therefore, initially, he had been diagnosed as non-specific interstitial pneumonia. However, imaging tests also showed mediastinum lymphadenopathy, and laboratory tests revealed increased interleukin-6. Idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease was suspected. The lung and mediastinum lymph node biopsies were performed, and pathological findings of the lymph nodes were compatible with multicentric Castleman disease. Pathological findings of the lung showed that the fibrous thickening of interstitium and the collapse of alveoli. We diagnosed this case as idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease preceded by diffuse interstitial lung disease. Treatment with prednisolone improved the dyspnea, and the pulmonary lesions disappeared.
