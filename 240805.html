MZL represents 7% of all mature NHLs that exhibit geographical variability in their incidence and association with infectious agents. Each MZL subtype is characterized by unique biology, clinical presentation, therapeutic approach, and natural history. Recent findings have improved risk stratification of patients at diagnosis and after frontline therapy; however, these data are not incorporated into treatment decisions or selections of therapeutic agents. Moreover, a limited number of patients with MZL have been enrolled in randomized clinical trials, and all subtypes have been analyzed as a single group.

MZL represents 7% of all mature NHLs that exhibit geographical variability in their incidence and association with infectious agents. Each MZL subtype is characterized by unique biology, clinical presentation, therapeutic approach, and natural history. Recent findings have improved risk stratification of patients at diagnosis and after frontline therapy; however, these data are not incorporated into treatment decisions or selections of therapeutic agents.

The stomach is the most commonly affected organ and the MALT lymphoma pathogenesis is clearly associated with Helicobacter pylori gastroduodenitis. Inflammation induces the lymphoid infiltrates in extranodal sites, where the lymphoma then subsequently develops. Genetic aberrations arise through the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), H. pylori-induced endonucleases, and other effects. The involvement of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway activation, a critical regulator of pro-inflammatory responses, further highlights the role of inflammation in gastric MALT lymphoma. The NF-κB pathway regulates key elements of normal lymphocyte function, including the transcription of proliferation-promoting and anti-apoptotic genes. Aberrant constitutive activation of NF-κB signaling can lead to autoimmunity and malignancy. NF-κB pathway activation can happen through both the canonical and non-canonical pathways and can be caused by multiple genetic aberrations such as t(11;18)(q12;q21), t(1;14)(p22;q32), and t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocations, chronic inflammation and even directly by H. pylori-associated mechanisms.

The stomach is the most commonly affected organ and the MALT lymphoma pathogenesis is clearly associated with Helicobacter pylori gastroduodenitis.

The chronic inflammation of gastric mucosa by H. pylori infection induces lymphomagenesis. Although this chronic mucosal inflammation also results in atrophic gastritis, evidence supporting the possible significance of atrophic gastritis in gastric lymphomagenesis is scarce. Here, to evaluate the association between gastric mucosal atrophy and the risk of gastric lymphoma, we conducted a matched case-control study at Aichi Cancer Center focusing on the attribution of H. pylori infection status and pepsinogen (PG) serum levels. In total, 86 patients with gastric lymphoma (including 49 cases of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) and 24 cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)) and 1720 non-cancer controls were included. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were assessed by conditional logistic regression analysis with adjustment for potential confounders. Results failed to show a statistically significant association between atrophic gastritis and the risk of gastric lymphoma. The adjusted ORs of positive atrophic gastritis relative to negative for overall gastric lymphoma, MALT lymphoma, DLBCL, and other lymphomas were 0.77 (95% CI 0.45-1.33), 0.65 (0.30-1.39), 1.03 (0.38-2.79), and 0.84 (0.22-3.29), respectively. In contrast, a positive association between overall gastric lymphoma and H. pylori infection was observed (OR\u2009=\u20092.14, 95% CI 1.30-3.54). A consistent association was observed for MALT lymphoma, DLBCL, and other lymphomas with ORs of 1.96 (1.00-3.86), 1.92 (0.74-4.95), and 5.80 (1.12-30.12), respectively. These findings suggest that H. pylori infection triggers gastric lymphoma but that epithelial changes due to atrophic gastritis do not inherently affect the development of gastric lymphoma.<div class="ref-data"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Ann%20Hematol.%202019%20Aug%3B98%288%29%3A1981-1987.%20doi%3A%2010.1007/s00277-019-03721-y.%20Epub%202019%20Jun%208." target="_blank">Ann Hematol. 2019 Aug;98(8):1981-1987. doi: 10.1007/s00277-019-03721-y.

The aim of this study was to reveal the characteristics of this disease entity. METHODS: A database search performed at the Department of Pathology of our institute identified 12 follicular lymphoma patients with involvement in the cecum, colon, and/or rectum. Data regarding the endoscopic, radiological, biological, and pathological examinations performed were retrospectively reviewed from their clinical records. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients (5 men, 7 women) was 58.7 years. Five patients were classified as being Lugano system stage I, while the other seven patients were stage IV. In all of the patients, colorectal follicular lymphoma presented with papular (n=4), polypoid (n=4), and flat elevated lesions (n=4). No erosions or ulcers were seen in any of the lesions.

We analyzed the CG/RLH and MALT lymphoma groups. The median percentage of IRTA1-positive cells was 0% (range 0%-90.6%) in the CG/RLH group and 43.5% (range 0%-97.6%) in the MALT lymphoma group (p < 0.0001). The median percentage of MNDA-positive cells was 32.4% (range 0%-97.6%) in the CG/RLH group and 55.1% (range 0%-97.6%) in the MALT lymphoma group (p = 0.0044). These results indicate that immunohistochemistry for IRTA1 and MNDA can help differentiate gastric MALT lymphoma from CG/RLH.<div class="ref-data"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=J%20Clin%20Exp%20Hematop.%202022%20Dec%2028%3B62%284%29%3A195-201.%20doi%3A%2010.3960/jslrt.22021.%20Epub%202022%20Nov%2028." target="_blank">J Clin Exp Hematop. 2022 Dec 28;62(4):195-201. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.22021.

SMZL lymphomagenesis involves antigen and/or superantigen stimulation and molecular deregulation of genes (NOTCH2 and KLF2) involved in the physiological differentiation of spleen marginal zone B cells. Diagnosis requires either spleen histology or, alternatively, the documentation of a typical cell morphology and immunophenotype on blood cells coupled with the detection of intrasinusoidal infiltration by CD20(+) cells in the bone marrow. Among B-cell tumors, deletion of 7q and NOTCH2 mutations are almost specific lesions of SMZL, thus representing promising diagnostic biomarkers of this lymphoma. Although the majority of SMZLs show an indolent course with a median survival of approximately 10 years, nearly 30% of patients experience a poor outcome. No randomized trials are reported for SMZL, and few prospective trials are available. A watch-and-wait approach is advisable for asymptomatic patients. Treatment options for symptomatic patients ranges from splenectomy to rituximab alone or combined with chemotherapy. In some geographic areas, a subset of patients with SMZL associates with hepatitis C virus infection, prompting virus eradication as an effective lymphoma treatment.

METHODS: This is a multi-centered, retrospective study. We reviewed 146 patients with MALT lymphoma in the stomach who underwent fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for t(11;18) translocation. Patients were subdivided into patients without t(11;18) translocation or extra copies of MALT1 (Group A, n = 88), patients with t(11;18) translocation (Group B, n = 27), and patients with extra copies of MALT1 (Group C, n = 31). The clinical background, treatment, and outcomes of each group were investigated. RESULTS: Groups A and C showed slight female predominance, whereas Group B showed slight male predominance. Mean ages and clinical stages at lymphoma diagnosis were not different between groups. Complete response was obtained in 61 patients in Group A (69.3%), 22 in Group B (81.5%), and 21 in Group C (67.7%). Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication alone resulted in complete remission in 44 patients in Group A and 13 in Group C. In Group B, 14 patients underwent radiotherapy alone, which resulted in lymphoma disappearance.

The stomach is the most commonly affected organ and the MALT lymphoma pathogenesis is clearly associated with Helicobacter pylori gastroduodenitis. Inflammation induces the lymphoid infiltrates in extranodal sites, where the lymphoma then subsequently develops. Genetic aberrations arise through the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), H. pylori-induced endonucleases, and other effects. The involvement of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway activation, a critical regulator of pro-inflammatory responses, further highlights the role of inflammation in gastric MALT lymphoma. The NF-κB pathway regulates key elements of normal lymphocyte function, including the transcription of proliferation-promoting and anti-apoptotic genes. Aberrant constitutive activation of NF-κB signaling can lead to autoimmunity and malignancy. NF-κB pathway activation can happen through both the canonical and non-canonical pathways and can be caused by multiple genetic aberrations such as t(11;18)(q12;q21), t(1;14)(p22;q32), and t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocations, chronic inflammation and even directly by H. pylori-associated mechanisms.

The stomach is the most commonly affected organ and the MALT lymphoma pathogenesis is clearly associated with Helicobacter pylori gastroduodenitis. Inflammation induces the lymphoid infiltrates in extranodal sites, where the lymphoma then subsequently develops. Genetic aberrations arise through the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), H. pylori-induced endonucleases, and other effects.

The NF-κB pathway regulates key elements of normal lymphocyte function, including the transcription of proliferation-promoting and anti-apoptotic genes. Aberrant constitutive activation of NF-κB signaling can lead to autoimmunity and malignancy. NF-κB pathway activation can happen through both the canonical and non-canonical pathways and can be caused by multiple genetic aberrations such as t(11;18)(q12;q21), t(1;14)(p22;q32), and t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocations, chronic inflammation and even directly by H. pylori-associated mechanisms.

The stomach is the most commonly affected organ and the MALT lymphoma pathogenesis is clearly associated with Helicobacter pylori gastroduodenitis. Inflammation induces the lymphoid infiltrates in extranodal sites, where the lymphoma then subsequently develops. Genetic aberrations arise through the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), H. pylori-induced endonucleases, and other effects. The involvement of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway activation, a critical regulator of pro-inflammatory responses, further highlights the role of inflammation in gastric MALT lymphoma. The NF-κB pathway regulates key elements of normal lymphocyte function, including the transcription of proliferation-promoting and anti-apoptotic genes. Aberrant constitutive activation of NF-κB signaling can lead to autoimmunity and malignancy. NF-κB pathway activation can happen through both the canonical and non-canonical pathways and can be caused by multiple genetic aberrations such as t(11;18)(q12;q21), t(1;14)(p22;q32), and t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocations, chronic inflammation and even directly by H. pylori-associated mechanisms.

Although this chronic mucosal inflammation also results in atrophic gastritis, evidence supporting the possible significance of atrophic gastritis in gastric lymphomagenesis is scarce. Here, to evaluate the association between gastric mucosal atrophy and the risk of gastric lymphoma, we conducted a matched case-control study at Aichi Cancer Center focusing on the attribution of H. pylori infection status and pepsinogen (PG) serum levels.

Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were assessed by conditional logistic regression analysis with adjustment for potential confounders. Results failed to show a statistically significant association between atrophic gastritis and the risk of gastric lymphoma.

The stomach is the most commonly affected organ and the MALT lymphoma pathogenesis is clearly associated with Helicobacter pylori gastroduodenitis. Inflammation induces the lymphoid infiltrates in extranodal sites, where the lymphoma then subsequently develops. Genetic aberrations arise through the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), H. pylori-induced endonucleases, and other effects. The involvement of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway activation, a critical regulator of pro-inflammatory responses, further highlights the role of inflammation in gastric MALT lymphoma. The NF-κB pathway regulates key elements of normal lymphocyte function, including the transcription of proliferation-promoting and anti-apoptotic genes. Aberrant constitutive activation of NF-κB signaling can lead to autoimmunity and malignancy. NF-κB pathway activation can happen through both the canonical and non-canonical pathways and can be caused by multiple genetic aberrations such as t(11;18)(q12;q21), t(1;14)(p22;q32), and t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocations, chronic inflammation and even directly by H. pylori-associated mechanisms.

METHODS: This is a multi-centered, retrospective study. We reviewed 146 patients with MALT lymphoma in the stomach who underwent fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for t(11;18) translocation. Patients were subdivided into patients without t(11;18) translocation or extra copies of MALT1 (Group A, n = 88), patients with t(11;18) translocation (Group B, n = 27), and patients with extra copies of MALT1 (Group C, n = 31). The clinical background, treatment, and outcomes of each group were investigated. RESULTS: Groups A and C showed slight female predominance, whereas Group B showed slight male predominance. Mean ages and clinical stages at lymphoma diagnosis were not different between groups. Complete response was obtained in 61 patients in Group A (69.3%), 22 in Group B (81.5%), and 21 in Group C (67.7%). Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication alone resulted in complete remission in 44 patients in Group A and 13 in Group C. In Group B, 14 patients underwent radiotherapy alone, which resulted in lymphoma disappearance. Although the difference was not statistically significant, event-free survival in Group C tended to be inferior to that in Group A (P = 0.10).

The stomach is the most commonly affected organ and the MALT lymphoma pathogenesis is clearly associated with Helicobacter pylori gastroduodenitis. Inflammation induces the lymphoid infiltrates in extranodal sites, where the lymphoma then subsequently develops. Genetic aberrations arise through the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), H. pylori-induced endonucleases, and other effects. The involvement of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway activation, a critical regulator of pro-inflammatory responses, further highlights the role of inflammation in gastric MALT lymphoma. The NF-κB pathway regulates key elements of normal lymphocyte function, including the transcription of proliferation-promoting and anti-apoptotic genes. Aberrant constitutive activation of NF-κB signaling can lead to autoimmunity and malignancy. NF-κB pathway activation can happen through both the canonical and non-canonical pathways and can be caused by multiple genetic aberrations such as t(11;18)(q12;q21), t(1;14)(p22;q32), and t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocations, chronic inflammation and even directly by H. pylori-associated mechanisms.

Recent advances in the biology and molecular characteristics of these lymphomas have further expanded our understanding of the heterogeneous nature of these lymphomas, with increasing recognition of specific disease entities within the broader categories of FL and MZL. Here, we discuss the conclusions of the 2022 International Consensus Classification of Mature Lymphoid Neoplasms (2022 ICC) dealing with FL, and review differences with the proposed WHO 5th Edition classification.

Importantly, large B-cell lymphoma with IRF4 rearrangement introduced as a provisional entity in the WHO 2017 is upgraded to a definite entity in the 2022 ICC.

Pylori) in the case of gastric Mucosa Associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) Lymphoma, can drive the pathogenesis of this cancer, through the autoantigenic stimulation of T cells, but there may also be other factors participating such autoimmune diseases. Initial staging should include total body computed tomography, bone marrow aspirate, and endoscopic investigation if indicated. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), should be performed to detect the presence of specific chromosomal translocations involving the MALT1 and BCL10 genes, which leads to the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Depending on the location and dissemination of the disease, different therapeutic choices may include targeted therapy against the etiopathogenetic agent, radiotherapy, immunochemotherapy, and biological drugs. The purpose of this review is to illustrate the complex biology and the diagnosis of this disease and to better define new treatment strategies.<div class="ref-data"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Cancers%20%28Basel%29.%202022%20Mar%2029%3B14%287%29%3A1742.%20doi%3A%2010.3390/cancers14071742." target="_blank">Cancers (Basel). 2022 Mar 29;14(7):1742. doi: 10.3390/cancers14071742.</a></div>'}, {'color_mapped': '<span style="background-color: #21a685;">Juárez-Salcedo LM(1), Castillo JJ(2).\n\nLymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) are indolent subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</span> <span style="background-color: #29af7f;">Both are typically CD5 and CD10 negative.</span> <span style="background-color: #20928c;">In recent years, there have been several scientific advances that have helped improve the diagnosis of these conditions.</span> <span style="background-color: #1e9d89;">These conditions have been managed similarly in previous years with observation in asymptomatic patients and systemic therapy in advanced stages.</span> <span style="background-color: #1f978b;">However, there are specific differences.</span> <span style="background-color: #24878e;">Differential responses are also seen with novel agents such as the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib.</span> <span style="background-color: #32648e;">It is encouraging to see that there several clinical trials specific for patients with LPL and MZL ongoing..</span><div class="ref-data"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Hematol%20Oncol%20Clin%20North%20Am.%202019%20Aug%3B33%284%29%3A639-656.%20doi%3A%2010.1016/j.hoc.2019.03.004.%20Epub%202019%20Apr%2030." target="_blank">Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 2019 Aug;33(4):639-656. doi: 10.1016/j.hoc.2019.03.004.

We review issues related to grading and alternative forms of FL especially those lacking the genetic hallmark of FL, the t(14;18) chromosomal alteration. Among them, t(14;18)-negative CD23+\u2009follicle center lymphoma has been proposed by the 2022 ICC as a provisional entity. Other follicle center-derived lymphomas such as pediatric-type follicular lymphoma, testicular follicular lymphoma, primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma, and large B-cell lymphoma with IRF4 rearrangement are considered distinct entities separate from conventional FL. Importantly, large B-cell lymphoma with IRF4 rearrangement introduced as a provisional entity in the WHO 2017 is upgraded to a definite entity in the 2022 ICC. We also discuss diagnostic strategies for recognition of MZLs including splenic MZL, extranodal MZL (MALT lymphoma), and primary nodal MZL. The importance of molecular studies in the distinction among marginal zone lymphoma subtypes is emphasized, as well as their value in the differential diagnosis with other B-cell lymphomas.<div class="ref-data"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Virchows%20Arch.%202023%20Jan%3B482%281%29%3A149-162.%20doi%3A%2010.1007/s00428-022-03432-2.%20Epub%202022%20Nov%2017." target="_blank">Virchows Arch. 2023 Jan;482(1):149-162. doi: 10.1007/s00428-022-03432-2.

Synchronous primary lung cancers with BALT lymphoma are seldom seen in patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung. Synchronous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and BALT lymphoma is an extremely rare occurrence. We report an unusual case of stage 4 BALT lymphoma requiring treatment that revealed an underlying ipsilateral mass causing a diagnostic dilemma. An 84-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, deep vein thrombosis, and thrombotic microangiopathy presented to the hospital with cough and dyspnea on exertion. A chest X-ray revealed right hemi-thorax opacification and computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed a large right effusion and a soft tissue density extending into the proximal right bronchus. She required repeated thoracentesis until the pleural fluid analysis showed the presence of small lymphocytes and bronchial washings revealed an abnormal B cell population consistent with extranodal marginal zone lymphoma. The patient received four cycles of bendamustine and rituximab resulting in near-complete resolution of the effusion. Four months from diagnosis, imaging showed an increase in the size of the soft tissue density with pathologic fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography (PET). A CT-guided biopsy was consistent with squamous cell lung cancer (SCLC) and radiotherapy was started for clinical stage 2 disease since the patient was not a surgical candidate. BALT lymphoma is a low-grade malignancy classified as extranodal marginal zone lymphoma with a five-year survival rate of over 80%.

The aim of this study was to reveal the characteristics of this disease entity. METHODS: A database search performed at the Department of Pathology of our institute identified 12 follicular lymphoma patients with involvement in the cecum, colon, and/or rectum. Data regarding the endoscopic, radiological, biological, and pathological examinations performed were retrospectively reviewed from their clinical records. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients (5 men, 7 women) was 58.7 years. Five patients were classified as being Lugano system stage I, while the other seven patients were stage IV. In all of the patients, colorectal follicular lymphoma presented with papular (n=4), polypoid (n=4), and flat elevated lesions (n=4). No erosions or ulcers were seen in any of the lesions. The initial pathological diagnoses included extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (n=2) and colitis/proctitis with infiltration of inflammatory cells (n=3), in addition to the correct diagnosis of follicular lymphoma (n=7). CONCLUSION: Colorectal involvement of follicular lymphoma shows no erosions or ulcers. These lesions could be macroscopically observed as papular, polypoid and flat elevated lesions.

The aim of this study was to reveal the characteristics of this disease entity. METHODS: A database search performed at the Department of Pathology of our institute identified 12 follicular lymphoma patients with involvement in the cecum, colon, and/or rectum. Data regarding the endoscopic, radiological, biological, and pathological examinations performed were retrospectively reviewed from their clinical records. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients (5 men, 7 women) was 58.7 years. Five patients were classified as being Lugano system stage I, while the other seven patients were stage IV. In all of the patients, colorectal follicular lymphoma presented with papular (n=4), polypoid (n=4), and flat elevated lesions (n=4). No erosions or ulcers were seen in any of the lesions. The initial pathological diagnoses included extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (n=2) and colitis/proctitis with infiltration of inflammatory cells (n=3), in addition to the correct diagnosis of follicular lymphoma (n=7). CONCLUSION: Colorectal involvement of follicular lymphoma shows no erosions or ulcers. These lesions could be macroscopically observed as papular, polypoid and flat elevated lesions.

Other follicle center-derived lymphomas such as pediatric-type follicular lymphoma, testicular follicular lymphoma, primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma, and large B-cell lymphoma with IRF4 rearrangement are considered distinct entities separate from conventional FL. Importantly, large B-cell lymphoma with IRF4 rearrangement introduced as a provisional entity in the WHO 2017 is upgraded to a definite entity in the 2022 ICC. We also discuss diagnostic strategies for recognition of MZLs including splenic MZL, extranodal MZL (MALT lymphoma), and primary nodal MZL.

In this manuscript, we attempted to integrate the currently available data on the clinicopathological features of follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT-L), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/ small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) affecting these anatomical regions. METHODS: An updated descriptive literature review was carried out and a detailed electronic search was done in multiple databases to gather all cases affecting the oral/maxillofacial region and palatine tonsils. RESULTS: We observed that MALT-L was the most frequently reported subtype, followed by FL, MCL, and CLL/SLL. The palate was affected in a high proportion of cases and the most usual clinical presentation was an asymptomatic swelling. MALT-L and CLL/SLL neoplastic cells were strongly associated with small salivary glands. FL showed no gender preference, while MCL and CLL/SLL were more prevalent in males and MALT-L in females.

An 82-year-old man presented with a 4 cm × 2.5 cm mass in the left parotid region. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) showed localized abnormal fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the left parotid gland and lymph nodes of the left cervical region. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of the left parotid gland showed lymphoplasmacytoid cells with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive Dutcher bodies. A subsequent excisional biopsy showed sheets of small- to medium-sized neoplastic B cells with abundant IgM in the cytoplasm as detected by immunohistochemistry. A diagnosis of stage II MALT lymphoma was made, but the patient did not receive therapeutic intervention. As previously reported, Dutcher bodies are mainly observed in B-cell neoplasms with IgM production. Because these characteristic intranuclear inclusions can be easily observed by PAS staining, the presence of PAS reaction-positive Dutcher bodies in FNA cytology can serve as a clue to differentially diagnose MALT lymphoma from plasmacytoma.

Synchronous primary lung cancers with BALT lymphoma are seldom seen in patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung. Synchronous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and BALT lymphoma is an extremely rare occurrence. We report an unusual case of stage 4 BALT lymphoma requiring treatment that revealed an underlying ipsilateral mass causing a diagnostic dilemma. An 84-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, deep vein thrombosis, and thrombotic microangiopathy presented to the hospital with cough and dyspnea on exertion. A chest X-ray revealed right hemi-thorax opacification and computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed a large right effusion and a soft tissue density extending into the proximal right bronchus. She required repeated thoracentesis until the pleural fluid analysis showed the presence of small lymphocytes and bronchial washings revealed an abnormal B cell population consistent with extranodal marginal zone lymphoma. The patient received four cycles of bendamustine and rituximab resulting in near-complete resolution of the effusion. Four months from diagnosis, imaging showed an increase in the size of the soft tissue density with pathologic fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake on positron emission tomography (PET). A CT-guided biopsy was consistent with squamous cell lung cancer (SCLC) and radiotherapy was started for clinical stage 2 disease since the patient was not a surgical candidate. BALT lymphoma is a low-grade malignancy classified as extranodal marginal zone lymphoma with a five-year survival rate of over 80%. Several cases of synchronous lung adenocarcinoma and BALT lymphoma have been described. However, our case is among the rare few cases of synchronous occurrence of SCLC with BALT lymphoma.

The aim of this study was to reveal the characteristics of this disease entity. METHODS: A database search performed at the Department of Pathology of our institute identified 12 follicular lymphoma patients with involvement in the cecum, colon, and/or rectum. Data regarding the endoscopic, radiological, biological, and pathological examinations performed were retrospectively reviewed from their clinical records. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients (5 men, 7 women) was 58.7 years. Five patients were classified as being Lugano system stage I, while the other seven patients were stage IV. In all of the patients, colorectal follicular lymphoma presented with papular (n=4), polypoid (n=4), and flat elevated lesions (n=4). No erosions or ulcers were seen in any of the lesions. The initial pathological diagnoses included extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (n=2) and colitis/proctitis with infiltration of inflammatory cells (n=3), in addition to the correct diagnosis of follicular lymphoma (n=7). CONCLUSION: Colorectal involvement of follicular lymphoma shows no erosions or ulcers. These lesions could be macroscopically observed as papular, polypoid and flat elevated lesions. Making a correct diagnosis of this disease based on the findings of biopsied samples is sometimes challenging. In such cases, multiple biopsies and/or endoscopic mucosal resection is required, in addition to appropriate consultation with pathologists.<div class="ref-data"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Intern%20Med.%202016%3B55%281%29%3A1-8.%20doi%3A%2010.2169/internalmedicine.55.5393.%20Epub%202016%20Jan%201." target="_blank">Intern Med. 2016;55(1):1-8. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.55.5393.

The aim of this study was to reveal the characteristics of this disease entity. METHODS: A database search performed at the Department of Pathology of our institute identified 12 follicular lymphoma patients with involvement in the cecum, colon, and/or rectum. Data regarding the endoscopic, radiological, biological, and pathological examinations performed were retrospectively reviewed from their clinical records. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients (5 men, 7 women) was 58.7 years. Five patients were classified as being Lugano system stage I, while the other seven patients were stage IV. In all of the patients, colorectal follicular lymphoma presented with papular (n=4), polypoid (n=4), and flat elevated lesions (n=4). No erosions or ulcers were seen in any of the lesions. The initial pathological diagnoses included extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (n=2) and colitis/proctitis with infiltration of inflammatory cells (n=3), in addition to the correct diagnosis of follicular lymphoma (n=7). CONCLUSION: Colorectal involvement of follicular lymphoma shows no erosions or ulcers. These lesions could be macroscopically observed as papular, polypoid and flat elevated lesions.

METHODS: An updated descriptive literature review was carried out and a detailed electronic search was done in multiple databases to gather all cases affecting the oral/maxillofacial region and palatine tonsils. RESULTS: We observed that MALT-L was the most frequently reported subtype, followed by FL, MCL, and CLL/SLL. The palate was affected in a high proportion of cases and the most usual clinical presentation was an asymptomatic swelling. MALT-L and CLL/SLL neoplastic cells were strongly associated with small salivary glands. FL showed no gender preference, while MCL and CLL/SLL were more prevalent in males and MALT-L in females. Overall, cases were more common in elderly individuals. Patients\' treatment and outcome varied, with MCL being the most aggressive neoplasm with a dismal prognosis in comparison to FL and MALT-L.

An 82-year-old man presented with a 4 cm × 2.5 cm mass in the left parotid region. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) showed localized abnormal fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the left parotid gland and lymph nodes of the left cervical region. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of the left parotid gland showed lymphoplasmacytoid cells with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive Dutcher bodies. A subsequent excisional biopsy showed sheets of small- to medium-sized neoplastic B cells with abundant IgM in the cytoplasm as detected by immunohistochemistry. A diagnosis of stage II MALT lymphoma was made, but the patient did not receive therapeutic intervention. As previously reported, Dutcher bodies are mainly observed in B-cell neoplasms with IgM production. Because these characteristic intranuclear inclusions can be easily observed by PAS staining, the presence of PAS reaction-positive Dutcher bodies in FNA cytology can serve as a clue to differentially diagnose MALT lymphoma from plasmacytoma.

Recent advances in the biology and molecular characteristics of these lymphomas have further expanded our understanding of the heterogeneous nature of these lymphomas, with increasing recognition of specific disease entities within the broader categories of FL and MZL. Here, we discuss the conclusions of the 2022 International Consensus Classification of Mature Lymphoid Neoplasms (2022 ICC) dealing with FL, and review differences with the proposed WHO 5th Edition classification. We review issues related to grading and alternative forms of FL especially those lacking the genetic hallmark of FL, the t(14;18) chromosomal alteration. Among them, t(14;18)-negative CD23+\u2009follicle center lymphoma has been proposed by the 2022 ICC as a provisional entity. Other follicle center-derived lymphomas such as pediatric-type follicular lymphoma, testicular follicular lymphoma, primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma, and large B-cell lymphoma with IRF4 rearrangement are considered distinct entities separate from conventional FL.

Recent advances in the biology and molecular characteristics of these lymphomas have further expanded our understanding of the heterogeneous nature of these lymphomas, with increasing recognition of specific disease entities within the broader categories of FL and MZL. Here, we discuss the conclusions of the 2022 International Consensus Classification of Mature Lymphoid Neoplasms (2022 ICC) dealing with FL, and review differences with the proposed WHO 5th Edition classification.

METHODS: This is a multi-centered, retrospective study. We reviewed 146 patients with MALT lymphoma in the stomach who underwent fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for t(11;18) translocation. Patients were subdivided into patients without t(11;18) translocation or extra copies of MALT1 (Group A, n = 88), patients with t(11;18) translocation (Group B, n = 27), and patients with extra copies of MALT1 (Group C, n = 31). The clinical background, treatment, and outcomes of each group were investigated. RESULTS: Groups A and C showed slight female predominance, whereas Group B showed slight male predominance. Mean ages and clinical stages at lymphoma diagnosis were not different between groups. Complete response was obtained in 61 patients in Group A (69.3%), 22 in Group B (81.5%), and 21 in Group C (67.7%). Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication alone resulted in complete remission in 44 patients in Group A and 13 in Group C. In Group B, 14 patients underwent radiotherapy alone, which resulted in lymphoma disappearance. Although the difference was not statistically significant, event-free survival in Group C tended to be inferior to that in Group A (P = 0.10). CONCLUSION: Patients with t(11;18) translocation should be treated differently from others.

METHODS: This is a multi-centered, retrospective study. We reviewed 146 patients with MALT lymphoma in the stomach who underwent fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for t(11;18) translocation. Patients were subdivided into patients without t(11;18) translocation or extra copies of MALT1 (Group A, n = 88), patients with t(11;18) translocation (Group B, n = 27), and patients with extra copies of MALT1 (Group C, n = 31). The clinical background, treatment, and outcomes of each group were investigated. RESULTS: Groups A and C showed slight female predominance, whereas Group B showed slight male predominance. Mean ages and clinical stages at lymphoma diagnosis were not different between groups. Complete response was obtained in 61 patients in Group A (69.3%), 22 in Group B (81.5%), and 21 in Group C (67.7%). Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication alone resulted in complete remission in 44 patients in Group A and 13 in Group C. In Group B, 14 patients underwent radiotherapy alone, which resulted in lymphoma disappearance. Although the difference was not statistically significant, event-free survival in Group C tended to be inferior to that in Group A (P = 0.10). CONCLUSION: Patients with t(11;18) translocation should be treated differently from others.

Here, we discuss the conclusions of the 2022 International Consensus Classification of Mature Lymphoid Neoplasms (2022 ICC) dealing with FL, and review differences with the proposed WHO 5th Edition classification.

METHODS: This is a multi-centered, retrospective study. We reviewed 146 patients with MALT lymphoma in the stomach who underwent fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for t(11;18) translocation. Patients were subdivided into patients without t(11;18) translocation or extra copies of MALT1 (Group A, n = 88), patients with t(11;18) translocation (Group B, n = 27), and patients with extra copies of MALT1 (Group C, n = 31). The clinical background, treatment, and outcomes of each group were investigated. RESULTS: Groups A and C showed slight female predominance, whereas Group B showed slight male predominance. Mean ages and clinical stages at lymphoma diagnosis were not different between groups. Complete response was obtained in 61 patients in Group A (69.3%), 22 in Group B (81.5%), and 21 in Group C (67.7%). Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication alone resulted in complete remission in 44 patients in Group A and 13 in Group C. In Group B, 14 patients underwent radiotherapy alone, which resulted in lymphoma disappearance. Although the difference was not statistically significant, event-free survival in Group C tended to be inferior to that in Group A (P = 0.10). CONCLUSION: Patients with t(11;18) translocation should be treated differently from others. Patients with extra copies of MALT1 could be initially treated with H. pylori eradication, similar to patients without t(11;18) translocation or extra copies of MALT1.<div class="ref-data"><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=World%20J%20Gastroenterol.%202017%20Sep%207%3B23%2833%29%3A6155-6163.%20doi%3A%2010.3748/wjg.v23.i33.6155." target="_blank">World J Gastroenterol. 2017 Sep 7;23(33):6155-6163. doi: 10.3748/wjg.v23.i33.6155.</a></div>'}];
